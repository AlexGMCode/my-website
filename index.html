                    <p>

                        In Final Fantasy XIV, tanks are the vanguards of any party, responsible for controlling enemy
                        aggro
                        and absorbing damage to protect their allies. Healers maintain the party's health through spells
                        and
                        abilities, ensuring that everyone can continue fighting by mitigating incoming damage and
                        reviving
                        fallen members. DPS (damage per second) roles focus on dealing damage to enemies, with
                        specializations that allow them to excel in either single-target or area-of-effect situations,
                        ensuring efficient combat progression.

                        Crafters and gatherers in Final Fantasy XIV provide essential support to the game's economy and
                        player progression by creating gear, consumables, and other valuable items. Gatherers supply raw
                        materials needed for crafting and contribute to quests and levequests, while crafters can
                        enhance
                        gear, craft housing items, and create end-game consumables. Their combined efforts enable
                        players to
                        customize their gameplay experience, improve their performance in battle, and engage in the

                        The Scions of the Seventh Dawn are a secretive group dedicated to ensuring the safety of Eorzea
                        from
                        existential threats, combining the efforts of two previous organizations, the Path of the Twelve
                        and
                        the Circle of Knowing. At the beginning of the A Realm Reborn expansion, they are at the
                        forefront
                        of the fight against the Garlean Empire and the primals, powerful beings summoned by the land's
                        beast tribes. Led by Minfilia Warde, the Scions operate out of the Waking Sands in Thanalan,
                        offering guidance, support, and intelligence to the realm's adventurers and city-states in these
                        tumultuous times.
