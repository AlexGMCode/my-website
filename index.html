        <h2>About this page</h2>
        <p id="about">Final Fantasy XIV is a game that is really accessible across a lot of platforms! 
            Part of this is due to the fact that it was orignally designed to incorporate the Playstation 3, 
            which was released 18 years ago! Today, that minimum requirement has been updated to meet 
            more modern standards but it is still relatively easy to <i>run</i>. This website is focused on 
            getting FFXIV to run <strong>well</strong> on PC!
        </p>
        <p>The key component that decides how FFXIV is what hardware it is running on. 
            Visit the <a href="Pages/hardware.html"><u>hardware page</u></a> for more info!
        </p>
        <p>Next we look at programs that enhance your experience within FFXIV. Head on over to the 
            <a href="Pages/software.html"><u>software page</u></a> if you're curious.
        </p>
        <p>Lastly we have some tools that inject themselves into FFXIV, providing for a seamless experience 
            when being utilized. The <a href="Pages/plugins.html"><u>plugins page</u></a> can get you started!
